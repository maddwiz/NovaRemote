# App Store Description Draft

NovaRemote turns your phone into an AI-powered remote terminal command center.

Control server sessions from anywhere, see live terminal output in real time, and speak commands hands-free in Glasses Mode (XREAL X1 and Halo presets included). NovaRemote combines fast mobile terminal access with AI assistance and fleet-scale controls so you can debug, deploy, and monitor on the go.

## Highlights

- AI Terminal Assistant: get command suggestions, explain terminal errors, and generate fix commands from real output context.
- Live Terminal Streaming: WebSocket-first session streaming with fallback polling, ANSI color rendering, search, and fullscreen mode.
- Fleet Execution: run one shell command across multiple servers with grouped results and per-server status.
- File and Process Tools: browse/read/edit/save files and inspect or kill remote processes.
- Session Superpowers: history, tags, pinning, recordings with playback/export, offline queue, watch alerts, and spectator links.
- Security-First: local secure storage, biometric lock, dangerous-command confirmation, token-free server sharing.

## Built For
