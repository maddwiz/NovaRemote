# Media Assets

Store product media for README/App Store/TestFlight here.

Recommended files:

- `terminal-live.png`
- `ai-suggestions.png`
- `fleet-run.png`
- `glasses-mode.png`
- `demo-terminal.gif`
- `demo-fleet.gif`

Keep tokens/URLs private in all captures.

Recommended video files:

- `demo-terminal.mp4`
- `demo-ai-fleet.mp4`
- `demo-glasses-mode.mp4` (optional)

Current repo includes placeholder 1x1 assets so README links resolve in fresh clones.
Replace all placeholder media with real captures before store submission and launch.
