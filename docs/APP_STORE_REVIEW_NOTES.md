Review test server:
- URL: <replace-with-review-server-url>
- Bearer token: <replace-with-review-token>

How to verify quickly:
1. Open app and complete onboarding.
2. Add the server URL/token above.
3. Open Terminals tab and create a shell session.
4. Send `echo hello` and confirm live output streaming.
5. Optional: open Glasses mode and test voice capture/transcript flow.

No consumer account is required to use core terminal features.
